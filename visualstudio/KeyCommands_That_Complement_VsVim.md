# Key Commmands That Complement VsVim

Visual Studio is full of key commands, but I've disabled a lot of them in favor of the commands provided by VsVim. The following is a list of commands that do things that VsVim can't do, and are essential for using Visual Studio without a mouse.

| Shortcut   |   Effect      |
|------------|---------------|
| Ctrl + -   | Navigate Back |
| Ctrl [ + s | Goto Solution Explorer and Scroll To Open File |
| Ctrl + ;   | Goto Solution Explorer |
| F9 | Add / Remove Breakpoint | 
| F12 | Go To Definition | 
| Ctrl + Alt + b | Go to Breakpoints Panel | 
| Ctrl + Alt + h | Go to Threads Panel | 
| Ctrl + Alt + c | Go To Callstack Panel | 


The following are key shortcuts I added to Visual Studio (using the Tools->Options->Environment->Keyboard menu. 

| Shortcut | Effect | 
| Shift + Alt + F | Go To Find Results 1 | 

There are still problems to be solved: 
* Resizing Panels Without a Mouse
* Changing Build Configurations Sanely (you can do it out of the box, it just sucks)
* Lots of others I haven't stopped to write down when they happen
