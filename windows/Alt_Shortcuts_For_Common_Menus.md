# Alt Shortcuts for Common Menus

If you're in a normal win32 app (like notepad, or visual studio), you can hold the alt key to reveal shortcuts for opening common menus (like File or View). 

Holding the alt key will reveal an underline below a single letter in the name of most menus (non standard menus may not support this). Pressing alt + that underlined letter will open that menu and snap keyboard focus to the first menu item. 

Once in the menu, more underlines will be shown, under a single letter of menu item names. Pressing that letter will select that menu item.
